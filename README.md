Network Scanning: The script initiates a network scan by pinging IP addresses within a predefined range. It seeks an available IP address that is not currently in use by any other device on the network.

IP Address Switching: Once an available IP address is found, the script replaces the current IP address of the computer with the newly discovered one. The IP address change occurs automatically without requiring manual intervention from the user.

Network Interface Reset: Following the IP address change, the script resets the network interface to ensure that the change takes effect immediately.
